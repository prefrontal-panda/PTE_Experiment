# PTE_Experiment
This repository is to store code related to the analysis of omics data from the post-traumatic experiment. 
Post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) can develop in a subset of individuals who have suffered from a traumatic brain injury (TBI). 
The molecular architecture underpinning these two disorders are largely unknown.

This experiment is the second experiment for my PhD thesis. Here, I attempt to distangle the molecular contributors of PTE from those of TBI.

In this experiment, four groups of rats were compared:
(i) Naives
(ii) Shams
(iii) TBI only rats (TBI - PTE)
(iv) TBI and PTE rats (TBI + PTE)

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (10 - 11 weeks old) were given either a lateral fluid percussion injury (in the case of the TBI - PTE and TBI + PTE groups) or a craniotomy (shams).
They were then left for 6 months before undergoing behavioural testing, and video electroencephalogram (vEEG) recordings.
Finally, the perilesional cortex was collected at 7 months and the transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome profiled.
